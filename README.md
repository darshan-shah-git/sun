Simple public domain library and application that shows sunset and
sunrise based on your latitude,longitude.

The library, which can be used entirely stand-alone, is based on the
excellent code by [Paul Schlyter][].

The goal of this project is to provide just enough intelligence to
my home automation system so it can control the indoor lights, which
are operated using 433 MHz outlet switches.
